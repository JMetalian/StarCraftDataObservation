# StarCraft Data Observation

This is a research project on Data Analysis in Star Craft 2. By using different Machine Learning Algorithms, we are evaluating each of them for their properness. While their comparison is happening, at the same time, the data is explored.

The searched topics were:
1-How do the replay attributes differ by level of player expertise?
2-What are significant predictors of a player's league?
